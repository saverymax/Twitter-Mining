The following are my personal notes as I work on the project.

Current Work

dates are backwards and weird in time series. fine when I use converted_csv, not when I use converted_csv_sentiment
normalize likes, retweets, and sentiment so I can plot on one plot

figure out how I want to do the sentiment analysis

train based on angry, arrogant, nostalgic, exaggerating? 

why is there a single #? is that coming from the tokenizer or is it in the tweets?
also, I have fewer hashtags than I used to. See saved hashtag png. 
try using regex for hashtags. see regex in code

make more oop

Future plans:
see bar graph of word usage week by week...and mood changes

tech notes:

installed textblob for sentiment analysis
pip install -U textblob
$ python -m textblob.download_corpora
