The following are my personal notes as I work on the project.

shit, deleted config and plotly credentials, somehow when I checkedout

    maybe:

            @jaycech3n hey, you're correct, thank you for that. I assumed I was already using tweet_mode='extended' but I was not. For other people the way to go is:

        a = api.get_status(912886007451676672, tweet_mode='extended')

can get one interacting plot with two data sets.
but want two subplots with two data sets.

interacting subplots

and to make subplots:

need some way to describe what polarity and sentiment are

normalize likes, retweets, and sentiment so I can plot on one plot

figure out how I want to do the sentiment analysis

train based on angry, arrogant, nostalgic, exaggerating? 

why is there a single #? is that coming from the tokenizer or is it in the tweets?
also, I have fewer hashtags than I used to. See saved hashtag png. 
try using regex for hashtags. see regex in code

Future plans:
word usage in a time series...and mood changes
<<<<<<< HEAD
colors, axis names
statistics on time series
apply to other people, need to make paths non hardcoded, and saved/opened files

good stuff in R, like topic modeling

tech notes:

installed textblob for sentiment analysis
pip install -U textblob
$ python -m textblob.download_corpora
