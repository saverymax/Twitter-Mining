## What's up, Twitter?

This project site documents my work using twitter to explore chaos that is Twitter and the people that compose social networks. I'm still getting started putting together the site and building pipelines.

Current work: Making more bots, apps, expanding to other social media sites, refining some features of the topic model, designing more time series, and following the chaos on twitter/national politics.
