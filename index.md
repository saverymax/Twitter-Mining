## What's up, Twitter?

This project site documents my work using twitter to explore the chaos that is Twitter and the people that compose social networks. I'm still getting started putting together the site and building pipelines.

I've got two apps too

An app that tracks [controversial political terms on twitter](http://ec2-18-191-153-73.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/) 


And an app that tracks [Congress's activity on Twitter](https://congressontwitter.herokuapp.com/)

Current work: Making more bots, apps, expanding to other social media sites, refining some features of the topic model, designing more time series, and following the chaos on twitter/national politics.
