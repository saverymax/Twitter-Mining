Current work: 

overwriting listener class:
use: http://stats.seandolinar.com/collecting-twitter-data-using-a-python-stream-listener/
http://badhessian.org/2012/10/collecting-real-time-twitter-data-with-the-streaming-api/


the way I dump tweets does not dump tweet by tweet. need to dump status by status. 
plot streaming data
add in graphing features and text filtering
name the file as .join(termlist)


future:
sentiment analysis
add the command line utility to other files in twitter-mining directory
use methods in tweepy docs https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/blob/master/tweepy/streaming.py to set time limit and disconnect.
