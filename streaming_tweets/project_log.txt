Current work: 

analysis working, go to next step
but what's with the limit in the twitter.py file. Check tweepy source
    it's a limit notice. Given by twitter when I have reached limit. How should I deal with it?

plot time_series streaming data
add in graphing features and text filtering
networks! see refs in trump dir. Some possibilities for R. 

future:
sentiment analysis
add the command line utility to other files in twitter-mining directory
use methods in tweepy docs https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/blob/master/tweepy/streaming.py to set time limit and disconnect.
