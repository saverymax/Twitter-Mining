Current work: 

search for conservative, black, white
compare users, timeseries of topics, of word usage

improve sentiment analysis, try diff algo

working on deciding how to handle retweets, extended text. If i get extended rt, I lose the RT in front of it which is nice to know that it's a retweet
   
also don't know why I keep getting extended key error. I did know then I forgot


topic modeling:

would be nice to choose topic# in command line for py script

save frequency charts with unique name/method
    and tsne name with method
        just so I can save unique charts


filtering:

remove spanish, or at least spanish stopwords
